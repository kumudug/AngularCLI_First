# AngularCLI_First

You need to install angular cli globally. 
To check the version installed use "ng --version"

ng new my-app --> Generate a new app

ng new my-app --dry-run --> Doesn't write files but reports them

ng new my-app --skip-install --> Doesn't run npm install

new new --help --> Says all the options
